Lab1 Project: VLAN Segmentation and Telnet Access
Objective

Configure a small network with 6 PCs and 2 Cisco 2960 switches. The network is segmented into three VLANs, and Telnet access is restricted to one VLAN.

Configuration Highlights

VLANs created for network segmentation

Telnet access restricted to one VLAN

Redundant link between switches ensures network reliability

PCs configured to connect to their respective VLANs

Demonstration

Telnet login from allowed VLAN

Ping tests between PCs in same and different VLANs

Verification of redundant link operation

Lab3 Project: 
Configuration Highlights

VLANs configured with dedicated subnets for X, Y, Z segments

Trunk ports between switches and routers

L3 switch configured with default route toward router 2911

Router 2911 configured with static routes toward all internal networks

PCs configured with IPs in their respective VLANs

Inter-router connectivity configured with IPs from a reserved range

Demonstration

Test connectivity between all VLANs using ping / simple PDU

Verify routing between subnets via routers

Confirm that new segment is fully integrated with the previous network
