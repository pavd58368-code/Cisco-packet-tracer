Lab Project: VLAN Segmentation and Telnet Access
Objective

Configure a small network with 6 PCs and 2 Cisco 2960 switches. The network is segmented into three VLANs, and Telnet access is restricted to one VLAN.

Configuration Highlights

VLANs created for network segmentation

Telnet access restricted to one VLAN

Redundant link between switches ensures network reliability

PCs configured to connect to their respective VLANs

Demonstration

Telnet login from allowed VLAN

Ping tests between PCs in same and different VLANs

Verification of redundant link operation
